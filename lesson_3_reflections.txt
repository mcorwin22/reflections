When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To keep a backup of your work, should anything happen to the local files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Some changes may have come from other users and could impacct your work locally in an unexpected way.
