When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To keep a backup of your work, should anything happen to the local files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Some changes may have come from other users and could impacct your work locally in an unexpected way.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks create a new repository on your account, copying from the original.
Clones copy a repository from GitHub into your local repository.
Branches diverge from the master path, allowing you to create new changes without affecting the original.
