What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is created. This stores the metadata for your depository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the intermediary between the working direction and the repository.
It allows you to create commits in groups of files that make sense.
